# 3D-Printed-Microscope by Group 1

In this project, open source innovation in software development and hardware design has been explored. The project was modelled upon Richard Bowman’s OpenFlexure Microscope project that is available on GitHub [1]. 
 
The OpenFlexure Microscope is a 3D printed microscope which uses a mechanical stage to precisely move the sample and focus the image. The microscope is connected to a Raspberry Pi mini controller and a Raspberry Pi camera module V2 which serves as an optical system that allows (21.8 ± 0.3) times optical magnification. The integration of remote motor controls allows for a low-cost and easily maintainable microscope that can be utilised in hostile environments, such as under fume hoods, for an extended period of time. 
 
We also have a blog at diymicroscopy.blogspot.com with a detailed instruction manual on assembling the microscope as well as an account of our experiments. In the spirit of open collaboration.
